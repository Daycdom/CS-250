Sprint Review and Retrospective final project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are utilized to create user stories, the needs define the requirements which are then split up into small pieces as the needs are the priority of agile. These small pieces then turn into user stories which can be adjusted as necessary. User stories help organize the tasks and create a backlog of tasks to complete that can be prioritized and changed as needed. It allows the developers to understand the needs and develop the project to the degree the customer wants.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The first step to development is understanding the end goal and the requirements to get there. This can be done through research or communication with the customer/product owner The second step would be to break it down as much as viable to create many small pieces of the project to then organize and prioritize, as well as understanding which may have prerequisites. The comes development, which each piece is developed seperately and put together in a final product after testing and reviewing with the customer. These pieces may change as time goes on, so that should be understood as well. Knowing the customers priorities also helps  as it declares the scope of the project.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member, communication is key. Transparency is the result of communication, and transparency allows you to work effectively with your team members. This includes collabarating with team members, being open to feedback, and communicating your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as being open to someones feedback about said streengths and weaknesses as this allows you to pair with someone when necessary to cover for those.
